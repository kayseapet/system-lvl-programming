# CSC 3320: System-Level Programming 
This course serves as an introduction to the fundamental interactions between computer hardware and software. We explore the architecture of UNIX-family operating systems, which provide the framework for executing programs and managing files. The curriculum focuses on developing high-performance applications using the C programming language, emphasized for its efficiency, portability, and direct integration with the UNIX operating system through system calls. 

### Key Areas of Study
* **The UNIX Environment**: Mastery of the Command Line Interface (CLI) and shell environments for navigating directory structures and managing file systems.
* **System Software Components**: Understanding the role of the Kernel in memory management, resource scheduling, and security.
* **C Programming**: Utilizing the standard library for input/output, string handling, and storage allocation to build robust system applications.
* **Automation and Scripting**: Developing shell scripts in Bash to automate complex sequences of commands and system tasks.
* **Remote Server Management**: Learning to securely connect to instructional servers like Snowball using the SSH protocol and managing remote files via SFTP.
* **Permissions and Security**: Managing file access through user, group, and other permissions using utilities such as chmod.
